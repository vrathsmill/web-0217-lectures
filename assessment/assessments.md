We want to see assess your comfort level with Object-Oriented Ruby, sql, and the parts of sinatra that we covered.

To begin, please install the gem gist. Instructions available here: https://github.com/defunkt/gist

When you're done, make a Gist of your entire folder and send it to us here: https://goo.gl/forms/qVLFdR5MVzNyQNJq1


Ruby
- Begin with the object_relations folder. We're going to be building out Yelp with a focus on object-orientation without a database or ActiveRecord.
- Write out the domain model. We're going to have customers, restaurants, and reviews.
- Open notes.rb, there is a list of Ruby methods we want you to write. Class instances can be stored in an class variable.

SQL
- Begin with the SQL-Relations file. We're going to be building out Yelp.
- Write out the domain model for Yelp. We're going to have customers, restaurants, restaurant owners, and reviews.
- When you finish the modeling out the domain, open the models folder. We've added empty models on each class that we want you to complete. Fill out the methods using SQL.

Sql Sinatra
  Write out the Restful actions in the users_controller file
