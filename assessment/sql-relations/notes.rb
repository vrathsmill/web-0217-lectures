# Ok, now we have a totally different website then in object relations section.
# Please don't base your answers on your ruby work.

# Consider how a yelp site is organized
# We need customers, restaurants, owners, and reviews.  How do they link up?

# 1. As a first step
# Please write out the domain model on this file
# What we are concerned about is which tables have foreign keys
# Don't stress: There may be multiple correct answers based on your conception of the problem.

# Eg. for our books and authors your deliverable would look like

# books
id | title | author_id

# author
id | name |

# Hints:
# - The data always lives on the belongs to relationship
# - Do the belongs_to first
# - Then do the has_many
# - If there is a many to many, we need a third table

# Write your answer here.

  #customer
  id | name | birth_year |hometown

  #owner
  id | name |

  #restaurant
  id | name | location | owner_id

  #review

  id | customer_id | restaurant_id 

# 2. As a second step, please fill in the stubbed out methods in the respective model.
# Customer#reviews
# Owner#restaurants
# Restaurant#owner
# Review#customer
# Review#restaurant
